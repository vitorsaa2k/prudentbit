### Setup instructions
Just run `npm ci` and `npm run dev`. server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

Or just use the deployed version at `https://prudentbit-five.vercel.app`

### Architectural decisions
- I did not have enough time to add filters and responsivity. But all of them was planned to be added.
- Debounced search inclunding multiple fields is avaliable(patient_name and medical_issue).
- Pagination is also included.
